# India_Bank_loan_Dashboard

The Bank Loan Dashboard Power BI project offers a comprehensive multi-page visualization of the bank's loan portfolio, sourced from the bank's loan management system and stored in a CSV file. It includes an Overview page with high-level summaries of total loan amounts, loan counts, and status distributions; a Loan Performance page with detailed analyses by loan amount, borrower's credit score, and loan type; a Borrower Analysis page with insights into borrower demographics like age, income, and credit score distributions; and a Loan Application Analysis page highlighting application volumes, status distributions, and rejection reasons. This project equips bank managers with actionable insights to enhance decision-making and optimize loan processes.
